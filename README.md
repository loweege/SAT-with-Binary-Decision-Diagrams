# SAT-with-Binary-Decision-Diagrams
Binary Decision Diagrams (BBDs) are the youngest and most efficient data structures in town!

A binary decision diagram can be seen as the weird cousin of the binary decision tree. A graphical representation of both the structures can be found below.Â

But if they are so useful, how can I apply them in real-life? Well, if that is the question you were thinking of, it is time to celebrate! Why? Because here you can find some practical and useful examples of their application.

The main library considered is [OxiDD](https://github.com/tweag/oxidd), a state-of-the-art, highly modular decision diagram framework written in Rust.
